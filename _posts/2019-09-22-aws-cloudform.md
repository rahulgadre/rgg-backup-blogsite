The official definition of AWS Cloudformation can be found in AWS documentation. 
However, in simple terms, AWS Cloudformation is an AWS service that lets to deploy AWS resources by using a code. 
It can also be recognized as an infrastructure as code service. The code to deploy AWS resources is written in either JSON or YAML format. 
A stack is then created and deployed which will then execute the code and deploy AWS resources as per the code.

The following YAML code shows the deployment of 2 EC2 instances using AWS Cloudformation. 
Several other variations can be tested by tweaking some of the properties shown in the code below.

``` yml
