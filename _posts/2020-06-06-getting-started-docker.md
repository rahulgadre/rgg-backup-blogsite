So you want to get started with Docker üê≥. Good choice, but it's important to have the right resources to get started with Docker. 
This post is about the resources that I would recommend based on my experience. 

- Docker 101 Series, DevCom --- Virginia Tech Video Series
- Docker Mastery Course on Udemy by Bret Fisher
- Play-with-docker -- an online tool that lets you get started with Docker without any installation.
- DockerCon videos
- Local meetup group

### Docker 101 Series

I highly recommend this Docker 101 series from Virginia Tech if you want to get a mile wide knowledge of Docker. It's a 4 part video series which covers the basics of Docker, contains demos, and quickly discusses some high level topics. This is a good series to get started. Here's the link to the webpage which contains all 4 parts of the series.

### Docker Mastery Course on Udemy

This is a fantastic course to get started with Docker. Taught by a Docker captain Bret Fisher who clearly knows how to teach.
The course price was $ 10 when I signed up but that may vary. Once you complete this course, you will have a clear understanding of how Docker works. Bret starts off this course assuming that you know nothing about Docker and then builds on top of that. One particular thing that I liked about the course was the way Bret designed the assignments in the course. Almost all the course assignments make you do your own research and don't give you answers right away. Check this course out. I am sure you won't regret it. Here's the link to the course on Udemy.

### Play-With-Docker üê≥

If you don't have a local environment setup or if you don't to set one up :) then this is a great resource. PWD can be accessed using a web browser and has everything you need to get started with Docker. All Docker shell commands, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm learning can be done on this site. Here's the link.

### DockerCon Videos

This can be a good resource to learn some advanced concepts of Docker. In my opinion, these videos will be helpful only if you have the basic knowledge of Docker. Most of the videos that I watched talked about some advanced topics in Docker and you may not get everything unless you know the basics or use Docker on a daily basis.

### Local meetup group

See if there is a local Docker meetup group. You can find it out on meetup.com. This can also be a good resource. This will allow you to get engaged with other Docker enthusiasts. Although I recommend this, I haven't found this as a good resource for me as there are no active Docker meetups happening in the Denver area. Your case could be different so check it out.
